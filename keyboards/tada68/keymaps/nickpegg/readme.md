# nickpegg's tada68 layout

* Caps Lock is ESC if tapped, Left Ctrl if held
* Volume shifted over, `,`=down, `.`=up, and `/`=mute. Makes <> do what you expect
* Fn + [ ] control screen backlight (`[`=down, `]`=up)
* Swap grave and escape, because grave not being there was maddening
* Fn+x toggles backlight breathing
